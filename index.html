                        <h2>GREAT BRANDS ARE HANDCRAFTED FROM GREAT STORIES.</h2>
                        <p>They stand the test of time. And they have an emotional connection that transcends their product or service. Anyone who wants to build a great brand first has to understand who they are. When you can sculpt your authentic values and beliefs into a clear identity and voice, you'll have the foundation for an excellent brand.</p>
                        <h2>THE WORKSHOP</h2>
                        <p>The Brand Bat workshop is an interactive, half-day experience for you and your team to chisel away the layers and get to the core of who you really are. We’ll make sure everyone understands the basics of branding, why it’s important, and how to fine-tune your story.</p>

                        <p>You’ve probably heard the phrase, “If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right.” In our opinion, everyone can benefit from having a clear brand strategy. If you’ve decided that you’re passionate enough to pursue something, then it’s worth building an excellent brand. We think this applies to everyone - businesses, non-profits, and individuals - whether you’re just starting out or have been around for years.</p>
